# JEI Integration - Minecraft Mod
_Providing Integrations & Tooltips_

## Description

JEI Integrations is an addon for Just Enough Items (JEI) that was originally called NEI Integration and was maintained by Tonius. However, since his absence the mod has yet to have been updated to support later versions of Minecraft. So, here it is. The mod adds helpful, highly-configurable tooltips, additional JEI recipe handlers for mods that yet to have native support and a few other helpful tools.

> **Disclaimer:** By default all parts of this mod are disabled. To enable them please use the in game config GUI by clicking Mods button (on the main menu), selecting JEI Integrations then clicking the config button.
